    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        It started with a shared love for adventure, music, and all the small in-between moments.
        From climbs and hikes to quiet nights in, every step brought us closer to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we’re counting down to celebrating with the people who’ve been part of that story — you.
